# SE-BIGDATA

App to participate in the study of new special system (SE) of the online game Hattrick (www.hattrick.org).
The final goal is to collect all important data of the match’s users and discover the % of appearance and conversion of special events.

### CURRENT STATUS : « Under construction »

This App already retrieves the user data from Hattrick successfully (with CHPP authentication) and this information is saved in main database correctly.
For the moment, with a console interface (works well under linux and windows).

Now, it's working on this features:
- How to send the data to the server to enrich the overall study.
- Generate (and print) the user's statistics (of special events).
