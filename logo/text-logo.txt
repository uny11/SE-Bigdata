New system of Specialties and Special Events

2017-05-09 10:49:00

Our new system of specialties is much more in detail balanced and go offer users the most interesting tactical variables, as well as new paths for a strategic construction of the team.

The key points of the change go be a new and more transparent way to generate special events, important changes in the effects of current specialties, two new unique player roles, and finally, the introduction of a completely new specialty.

Let's take a closer look at the changes:

A new specialty and new unique roles

We go introduce the "Team Player" specialty, we go renew the old "Quick Care" and appear two new unique roles, the "Powerful Forer" and the "Defensive Midfield".

Most important link between the specialty and skills

The specialties go now have a stronger bond with the skills of the players involved in the special event.

Generation process

The most important change is how to decide when and what special event happens, and how they are represented.

Now the game engine decides which team has the special event first, giving the team more likely to have it. Then a random player is chosen from the team that go have it. Finally, you choose a category of events to check (fast, corners, etc.) and check which of these can be displayed by the selected player.

This system makes it quite difficult to predict what go happen, and also complicates us to improve and match the system as a whole. So we have decided to change it totally.

In the future the process go follow a different logic. First the match engine go decide if there isSE-Bigdataevent. If there is one, you go choose between two main categories: team and individual events, and finally an event corresponding to this category.

Any event related to the whole team (corners, inexperience, ...) belongs to a team event. Those that involve one or two players are of the individual category, which go be more frequent, in general.

An important change is that each special event can happen more than once in a match. However, it go be increasingly difficult to happen.

Individual events
They are the most common and typical, such as Rapid that runs and marks or the one of Technician surpasses to a player with Air game.

When the game engine has decided that there go be an individual event, it go no longer verify the possession of the ball to decide which team has the opportunity, go check the players of both teams, their specialties and positions.

Example: If the engine decides to create a Rapid event, it go list all the relevant players on both teams and go randomly select who go be the event. In this way, comparing your alignment with that of the opponent, you go know what the probabilities of having a specific event, and this go lead to a new way of thinking tactics.

Team events
They go continue depending on the possession, if the engine generates one it go be more important than before, in a linear comparison between the qualifications of the middle of the field.

Climatic events
They go be out of the process of generating events. A check go be made at the start of the match and halfway. If one is generated, ALL the players of the game with the specific specialty go be affected, gaining or losing a fixed percentage of their total contribution. A time event usually lasts for the entire game. But sometimes an event that starts in the first part can be reverted to the second.

The weather go affect more players with specialties than before.

With the new generation code we believe we can level the specialties for their expected contribution and the frequency with which they happen, which was too difficult at the moment.

Specialties and events

We now check each specialty separately. For more details of each one, read our Dev Blog we have not published a general overview of all the skills that are used in each event.

Fast

Fast brand
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and dial. If the opponent in exactly the opposite position is also, then he has the 100% chance of stopping the attack. Nearby fast players can also stop him, but they have a much lower probability.

Fast it happens
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and take a pass.

Loss of rain and sun
If it rains or does Sol, all the fast ones go suffer.

Strengthening counterattacks
If you want to be a counter attack expert, you SE-Bigdata not only need to have past players, also fast players to take advantage of.SE-Bigdataextreme, middle center or fast forward SE-Bigdata give a small increase to the tactics of counterattacks. The effect SE-Bigdata not be linear, the range begins from 0 to 2'8 levels of tactics. Remember that your opponent can reduce or cancel this increase depending on the number of fast players that have central, lateral or half centers.

Technician

Technician surpasses an air game
Any extreme, middle center or forward can overtake a rival if the exact opposite position is a player with airplay.

Loss with rain, gain with sun
Nothing changesSE-Bigdatatechnical player SE-Bigdata suffer with rain or play better with Sun.

Forward defensive technicians
No change. They continue to have an increase of 33% of their past to the lateral attacks.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
When you recover the ball in your own field, it is good to have someone to take a long pass to make a counterattack. Each central and lateral technical defense SE-Bigdata give you a small chance of creating the counterattack from a failed attack on the opponent, regardless of the tactics selected. The probability increases for each technical defense that is had, but not linearly.

Marking man
During a marking to the man, if the objective is a technician, there are possibilities that the effect is greater thanSE-Bigdataother player. If you have a player nearby, you may not be able to carry out its magic.

Unpredictable

Pass by unpredictable
Goalkeepers, central and lateral can create a good opportunity with a long pass.

Unpredictable generates chance against
He leaves you hand in hand with the goalkeeper. This event is by extremes, half centers and forwards.

Unpredictable special action
Any unpredictable except for goalkeepers can dribble the opponent and take a good pass. The player who SE-Bigdata receive the pass as an extreme or a striker.

Unpredictable error
The sides, midfielders and midfielders may have a bad day and make a fatal mistake. An opposite end or front may take advantage of the situation.

Unpredictable dangers in the creative tactical game
Then we SE-Bigdata enter in detail, but the experience and the past SE-Bigdata be important forSE-Bigdataplayer to increase the creative tactical game.

Marking man
Since you can not foresee an unpredictable player, it SE-Bigdata be much more difficult to mark it than other people.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
The events "Unpredictable generates an occasion against" and "Special action of unpredictable", if it does an extreme or forwards and is bankrupt, it can end up in a counterattack by the rival.

Powerful

Pressure tactic
No change. The defense skill counts double the level of tactics.

Loss with sun, gain with rain
Like before, all the powerful SE-Bigdata suffer with the Sun, but they SE-Bigdata improve with the rain.

Power forward ("Power forward in normal")
If you have a good striker playing in normal, you can use your body in the fight with the opponent, forcing a second chance to kick and score after a normal chance that your team has failed. Think that this physical game can cause you to end up seeing the yellow card! For this reason, if you have already taught one, you SE-Bigdata be more careful when using your body.

Half defensive center ("Half center powerful in defense")
If you play your mid center powerful defensive you can concentrate on cutting off rival attacks and stealing the ball. If he does, the opponent's attack SE-Bigdata end.

Marking man
Powerful players score the best man.

Extremes

Far goes to company

If your end has surpassed the defense by the band, you can pass it to another extreme, forward or half offensive center

Far the center
As before, but if the receiver is an airborne player, it SE-Bigdata be much easier to score a goal.

Corner events
Now the corners SE-Bigdata be more frequent, but it SE-Bigdata not be easy to makeSE-Bigdataprofit.

Corner finalized bySE-Bigdataplayer
You need a good player with a good ball stopped, and your level of offensive indirect offensive ball SE-Bigdata be compared to the defense of your opponent. If the ball receiver has enough scoring ability to overtake the goalkeeper, then he SE-Bigdata score.

Corner kicked off by an airborne player
The same as before, but instead of having annotation skill, you just need to win the battle between the players with aerial game of both teams.

Both events may end up with a yellow card for the offensive team, but if your player already has a card he SE-Bigdata go with more account, so the risk of a second card is less.

Inexperience

We now compare the total experience of teams when such an event occurs. But if a team plays with a player less, the total experience is less and therefore is more likely to have an inexperience event. We SE-Bigdata now use the average.

Forward experienced brand
If your striker has a lot of experience compared to the average of the rivals, and has the ability to score sufficiently high to beat the goal keeper, then it can be scored.

Inexperienced defense
Just like before If your defense has little experience compared to the average rival team, they can exploit their errors. If it happens, a rival player can win the ball and have the option to score.

Resilent (formerly known as Quick Care)

Players with quick care are not a myth. They exist, and now we SE-Bigdata have to be born 50 times more frequently. Your injuries are less severe, and they cure more quickly. They SE-Bigdata also begin to diminish their abilities at an age slightly higher than the other players. To reflect its vigor and durability, we have renamed it "Resilent."

Game of specialties

We SE-Bigdata redesign the tactics and now there SE-Bigdata be a level of tactics, likeSE-Bigdataother. You SE-Bigdata increase the maximum number of special events of the match, but you SE-Bigdata also reduce your defensive qualification. Both the experience and the past (this one more than the first one) SE-Bigdata be important for the tactics game of specialties and the unpredictable ones SE-Bigdata have a double effect.

Teams that play with this tactic SE-Bigdata also increase the likelihood that when there is a special event, this team SE-Bigdata be the one who has it, regardless of the possession or the number of players with specialty of your team. If both teams play like that, either of them has this advantage.

Penalty for too many unique players

Counted and debated, we now have three combinations of specialties and positions, which make unique players appear: Defensive technical forwards, Power forwarders in normal, and Mig strong defensive centers. If you aligned two of the same type, you SE-Bigdata receive a penalty for your contribution. If you aligned three, it SE-Bigdata still be bigger. The effect of the penalty SE-Bigdata be relatively small, just big enough to make you think twice if you haveSE-Bigdataother alternative to aligning two equal unique players.

New specialty

A new specialty SE-Bigdata also be on Hattrick. The name SE-Bigdata be "Team Game". It SE-Bigdata be difficult to see, but not as fast as Cure. They SE-Bigdata begin appearing next season on the youth team, but we SE-Bigdata not make more information public, beyond the name of the specialty (N of the T: It is possible that the translators change the name of the specialty when we know what the players do with this specialty).

When SE-Bigdata all this happen?

We plan to implement these changes to the game at the end of the next season, but at the beginning they SE-Bigdata only be available in Tournaments matches, so everyone SE-Bigdata have the opportunity to try them or watch them, before they do not make the whole game effective 'here two seasons (at the beginning of 2018).

During this time, we may introduce some changes, as we hello hear your suggestions and continue testing and leveling the entire system. If this happens, we hello notify you before the final launch.

Both the experience and the past (this one more than the first one) SE-Bigdata be important for the tactics game of specialties and the unpredictable ones SE-Bigdata have a double effect.

Teams that play with this tactic SE-Bigdata also increase the likelihood that when there is a special event, this team SE-Bigdata be the one who has it, regardless of the possession or the number of players with specialty of your team. If both teams play like that, either of them has this advantage.

Penalty for too many unique players

Counted and debated, we now have three combinations of specialties and positions, which make unique players appear: Defensive technical forwards, Power forwarders in normal, and Mig strong defensive centers. If you aligned two of the same type, you SE-Bigdata receive a penalty for your contribution. If you aligned three, it SE-Bigdata still be bigger. The effect of the penalty SE-Bigdata be relatively small, just big enough to make you think twice if you haveSE-Bigdataother alternative to aligning two equal unique players.

New specialty

A new specialty SE-Bigdata also be on Hattrick. The name SE-Bigdata be "Team Game". It SE-Bigdata be difficult to see, but not as fast as Cure. They SE-Bigdata begin appearing next season on the youth team, but we SE-Bigdata not make more information public, beyond the name of the specialty (N of the T: It is possible that the translators change the name of the specialty when we know what the players do with this specialty).

When SE-Bigdata all this happen?

We plan to implement these changes to the game at the end of the next season, but at the beginning they SE-Bigdata only be available in Tournaments matches, so everyone SE-Bigdata have the opportunity to try them or watch them, before they do not make the whole game effective 'here two seasons (at the beginning of 2018).

During this time, we may introduce some changes, as we SE-Bigdata hear your suggestions and continue testing and leveling the entire system. If this happens, we SE-Bigdata notify you before the final launch.

New system of Specialties and Special Events

2017-05-09 10:49:00

Our new system of specialties is much more in detail balanced and SE-Bigdata offer users the most interesting tactical variables, as well as new paths for a strategic construction of the team.

The key points of the change SE-Bigdata be a new and more transparent way to generate special events, important changes in the effects of current specialties, two new unique player roles, and finally, the introduction of a completely new specialty.

Let's take a closer look at the changes:

A new specialty and new unique roles

We SE-Bigdata introduce the "Team Player" specialty, we SE-Bigdata renew the old "Quick Care" and appear two new unique roles, the "Powerful Forer" and the "Defensive Midfield".

Most important link between the specialty and skills

The specialties SE-Bigdata now have a stronger bond with the skills of the players involved in the special event.

Generation process

The most important change is how to decide when and what special event happens, and how they are represented.

Now the game engine decides which team has the special event first, giving the team more likely to have it. Then a random player is chosen from the team that SE-Bigdata have it. Finally, you choose a category of events to check (fast, corners, etc.) and check which of these can be displayed by the selected player.

This system makes it quite difficult to predict what SE-Bigdata happen, and also complicates us to improve and match the system as a whole. So we have decided to change it totally.

In the future the process SE-Bigdata follow a different logic. First the match engine SE-Bigdata decide if there isSE-Bigdataevent. If there is one, you SE-Bigdata choose between two main categories: team and individual events, and finally an event corresponding to this category.

Any event related to the whole team (corners, inexperience, ...) belongs to a team event. Those that involve one or two players are of the individual category, which SE-Bigdata be more frequent, in general.

An important change is that each special event can happen more than once in a match. However, it SE-Bigdata be increasingly difficult to happen.

Individual events
They are the most common and typical, such as Rapid that runs and marks or the one of Technician surpasses to a player with Air game.

When the game engine has decided that there SE-Bigdata be an individual event, it SE-Bigdata no longer verify the possession of the ball to decide which team has the opportunity, SE-Bigdata check the players of both teams, their specialties and positions.

Example: If the engine decides to create a Rapid event, it SE-Bigdata list all the relevant players on both teams and SE-Bigdata randomly select who SE-Bigdata be the event. In this way, comparing your alignment with that of the opponent, you SE-Bigdata know what the probabilities of having a specific event, and this SE-Bigdata lead to a new way of thinking tactics.

Team events
They SE-Bigdata continue depending on the possession, if the engine generates one it SE-Bigdata be more important than before, in a linear comparison between the qualifications of the middle of the field.

Climatic events
They SE-Bigdata be out of the process of generating events. A check SE-Bigdata be made at the start of the match and halfway. If one is generated, ALL the players of the game with the specific specialty SE-Bigdata be affected, gaining or losing a fixed percentage of their total contribution. A time event usually lasts for the entire game. But sometimes an event that starts in the first part can be reverted to the second.

The weather SE-Bigdata affect more players with specialties than before.

With the new generation code we believe we can level the specialties for their expected contribution and the frequency with which they happen, which was too difficult at the moment.

Specialties and events

We now check each specialty separately. For more details of each one, read our Dev Blog we have not published a general overview of all the skills that are used in each event.

Fast

Fast brand
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and dial. If the opponent in exactly the opposite position is also, then he has the 100% chance of stopping the attack. Nearby fast players can also stop him, but they have a much lower probability.

Fast it happens
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and take a pass.

Loss of rain and sun
If it rains or does Sol, all the fast ones SE-Bigdata suffer.

Strengthening counterattacks
If you want to be a counter attack expert, you SE-Bigdata not only need to have past players, also fast players to take advantage of.SE-Bigdataextreme, middle center or fast forward SE-Bigdata give a small increase to the tactics of counterattacks. The effect SE-Bigdata not be linear, the range begins from 0 to 2'8 levels of tactics. Remember that your opponent can reduce or cancel this increase depending on the number of fast players that have central, lateral or half centers.

Technician

Technician surpasses an air game
Any extreme, middle center or forward can overtake a rival if the exact opposite position is a player with airplay.

Loss with rain, gain with sun
Nothing changesSE-Bigdatatechnical player SE-Bigdata suffer with rain or play better with Sun.

Forward defensive technicians
No change. They continue to have an increase of 33% of their past to the lateral attacks.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
When you recover the ball in your own field, it is good to have someone to take a long pass to make a counterattack. Each central and lateral technical defense SE-Bigdata give you a small chance of creating the counterattack from a failed attack on the opponent, regardless of the tactics selected. The probability increases for each technical defense that is had, but not linearly.

Marking man
During a marking to the man, if the objective is a technician, there are possibilities that the effect is greater thanSE-Bigdataother player. If you have a player nearby, you may not be able to carry out its magic.

Unpredictable

Pass by unpredictable
Goalkeepers, central and lateral can create a good opportunity with a long pass.

Unpredictable generates chance against
He leaves you hand in hand with the goalkeeper. This event is by extremes, half centers and forwards.

Unpredictable special action
Any unpredictable except for goalkeepers can dribble the opponent and take a good pass. The player who SE-Bigdata receive the pass as an extreme or a striker.

Unpredictable error
The sides, midfielders and midfielders may have a bad day and make a fatal mistake. An opposite end or front may take advantage of the situation.

Unpredictable dangers in the creative tactical game
Then we SE-Bigdata enter in detail, but the experience and the past SE-Bigdata be important forSE-Bigdataplayer to increase the creative tactical game.

Marking man
Since you can not foresee an unpredictable player, it SE-Bigdata be much more difficult to mark it than other people.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
The events "Unpredictable generates an occasion against" and "Special action of unpredictable", if it does an extreme or forwards and is bankrupt, it can end up in a counterattack by the rival.

Powerful

Pressure tactic
No change. The defense skill counts double the level of tactics.

Loss with sun, gain with rain
Like before, all the powerful SE-Bigdata suffer with the Sun, but they SE-Bigdata improve with the rain.

Power forward ("Power forward in normal")
If you have a good striker playing in normal, you can use your body in the fight with the opponent, forcing a second chance to kick and score after a normal chance that your team has failed. Think that this physical game can cause you to end up seeing the yellow card! For this reason, if you have already taught one, you SE-Bigdata be more careful when using your body.

Half defensive center ("Half center powerful in defense")
If you play your mid center powerful defensive you can concentrate on cutting off rival attacks and stealing the ball. If he does, the opponent's attack SE-Bigdata end.

Marking man
Powerful players score the best man.

Extremes

Far goes to company

If your end has surpassed the defense by the band, you can pass it to another extreme, forward or half offensive center

Far the center
As before, but if the receiver is an airborne player, it SE-Bigdata be much easier to score a goal.

Corner events
Now the corners SE-Bigdata be more frequent, but it SE-Bigdata not be easy to makeSE-Bigdataprofit.

Corner finalized bySE-Bigdataplayer
You need a good player with a good ball stopped, and your level of offensive indirect offensive ball SE-Bigdata be compared to the defense of your opponent. If the ball receiver has enough scoring ability to overtake the goalkeeper, then he SE-Bigdata score.

Corner kicked off by an airborne player
The same as before, but instead of having annotation skill, you just need to win the battle between the players with aerial game of both teams.

Both events may end up with a yellow card for the offensive team, but if your player already has a card he SE-Bigdata go with more account, so the risk of a second card is less.

Inexperience

We now compare the total experience of teams when such an event occurs. But if a team plays with a player less, the total experience is less and therefore is more likely to have an inexperience event. We SE-Bigdata now use the average.

Forward experienced brand
If your striker has a lot of experience compared to the average of the rivals, and has the ability to score sufficiently high to beat the goal keeper, then it can be scored.

Inexperienced defense
Just like before If your defense has little experience compared to the average rival team, they can exploit their errors. If it happens, a rival player can win the ball and have the option to score.

Resilent (formerly known as Quick Care)

Players with quick care are not a myth. They exist, and now we SE-Bigdata have to be born 50 times more frequently. Your injuries are less severe, and they cure more quickly. They SE-Bigdata also begin to diminish their abilities at an age slightly higher than the other players. To reflect its vigor and durability, we have renamed it "Resilent."

Game of specialties

We SE-Bigdata redesign the tactics and now there SE-Bigdata be a level of tactics, likeSE-Bigdataother. You SE-Bigdata increase the maximum number of special events of the match, but you SE-Bigdata also reduce your defensive qualification. Both the experience and the past (this one more than the first one) SE-Bigdata be important for the tactics game of specialties and the unpredictable ones SE-Bigdata have a double effect.

Teams that play with this tactic SE-Bigdata also increase the likelihood that when there is a special event, this team SE-Bigdata be the one who has it, regardless of the possession or the number of players with specialty of your team.

Think that this physical game can cause you to end up seeing the yellow card! For this reason, if you have already taught one, you SE-Bigdata be more careful when using your body.

Half defensive center ("Half center powerful in defense")
If you play your mid center powerful defensive you can concentrate on cutting off rival attacks and stealing the ball. If he does, the opponent's attack SE-Bigdata end.

Marking man
Powerful players score the best man.

Extremes

Far goes to company

If your end has surpassed the defense by the band, you can pass it to another extreme, forward or half offensive center

Far the center
As before, but if the receiver is an airborne player, it SE-Bigdata be much easier to score a goal.

Corner events
Now the corners SE-Bigdata be more frequent, but it SE-Bigdata not be easy to makeSE-Bigdataprofit.

Corner finalized bySE-Bigdataplayer
You need a good player with a good ball stopped, and your level of offensive indirect offensive ball SE-Bigdata be compared to the defense of your opponent. If the ball receiver has enough scoring ability to overtake the goalkeeper, then he SE-Bigdata score.

Corner kicked off by an airborne player
The same as before, but instead of having annotation skill, you just need to win the battle between the players with aerial game of both teams.

Both events may end up with a yellow card for the offensive team, but if your player already has a card he SE-Bigdata go with more account, so the risk of a second card is less.

Inexperience

We now compare the total experience of teams when such an event occurs. But if a team plays with a player less, the total experience is less and therefore is more likely to have an inexperience event. We SE-Bigdata now use the average.

Forward experienced brand
If your striker has a lot of experience compared to the average of the rivals, and has the ability to score sufficiently high to beat the goal keeper, then it can be scored.

Inexperienced defense
Just like before If your defense has little experience compared to the average rival team, they can exploit their errors. If it happens, a rival player can win the ball and have the option to score.

Resilent (formerly known as Quick Care)

Players with quick care are not a myth. They exist, and now we SE-Bigdata have to be born 50 times more frequently. Your injuries are less severe, and they cure more quickly. They SE-Bigdata also begin to diminish their abilities at an age slightly higher than the other players. To reflect its vigor and durability, we have renamed it "Resilent."

Game of specialties

We SE-Bigdata redesign the tactics and now there SE-Bigdata be a level of tactics, likeSE-Bigdataother. You SE-Bigdata increase the maximum number of special events of the match, but you SE-Bigdata also reduce your defensive qualification. Both the experience and the past (this one more than the first one) SE-Bigdata be important for the tactics game of specialties and the unpredictable ones SE-Bigdata have a double effect.

Teams that play with this tactic SE-Bigdata also increase the likelihood that when there is a special event, this team SE-Bigdata be the one who has it, regardless of the possession or the number of players with specialty of your team. If both teams play like that, either of them has this advantage.

Penalty for too many unique players

Counted and debated, we now have three combinations of specialties and positions, which make unique players appear: Defensive technical forwards, Power forwarders in normal, and Mig strong defensive centers. If you aligned two of the same type, you SE-Bigdata receive a penalty for your contribution. If you aligned three, it SE-Bigdata still be bigger. The effect of the penalty SE-Bigdata be relatively small, just big enough to make you think twice if you haveSE-Bigdataother alternative to aligning two equal unique players.

New specialty

A new specialty SE-Bigdata also be on Hattrick. The name SE-Bigdata be "Team Game". It SE-Bigdata be difficult to see, but not as fast as Cure. They SE-Bigdata begin appearing next season on the youth team, but we SE-Bigdata not make more information public, beyond the name of the specialty (N of the T: It is possible that the translators change the name of the specialty when we know what the players do with this specialty).

When SE-Bigdata all this happen?

We plan to implement these changes to the game at the end of the next season, but at the beginning they SE-Bigdata only be available in Tournaments matches, so everyone SE-Bigdata have the opportunity to try them or watch them, before they do not make the whole game effective 'here two seasons (at the beginning of 2018).

During this time, we may introduce some changes, as we SE-Bigdata hear your suggestions and continue testing and leveling the entire system. If this happens, we SE-Bigdata notify you before the final launch.

New system of Specialties and Special Events

2017-05-09 10:49:00

Our new system of specialties is much more in detail balanced and SE-Bigdata offer users the most interesting tactical variables, as well as new paths for a strategic construction of the team.

The key points of the change SE-Bigdata be a new and more transparent way to generate special events, important changes in the effects of current specialties, two new unique player roles, and finally, the introduction of a completely new specialty.

Let's take a closer look at the changes:

A new specialty and new unique roles

We SE-Bigdata introduce the "Team Player" specialty, we SE-Bigdata renew the old "Quick Care" and appear two new unique roles, the "Powerful Forer" and the "Defensive Midfield".

Most important link between the specialty and skills

The specialties SE-Bigdata now have a stronger bond with the skills of the players involved in the special event.

Generation process

The most important change is how to decide when and what special event happens, and how they are represented.

Now the game engine decides which team has the special event first, giving the team more likely to have it. Then a random player is chosen from the team that SE-Bigdata have it. Finally, you choose a category of events to check (fast, corners, etc.) and check which of these can be displayed by the selected player.

This system makes it quite difficult to predict what SE-Bigdata happen, and also complicates us to improve and match the system as a whole. So we have decided to change it totally.

In the future the process SE-Bigdata follow a different logic. First the match engine SE-Bigdata decide if there isSE-Bigdataevent. If there is one, you SE-Bigdata choose between two main categories: team and individual events, and finally an event corresponding to this category.

Any event related to the whole team (corners, inexperience, ...) belongs to a team event. Those that involve one or two players are of the individual category, which SE-Bigdata be more frequent, in general.

An important change is that each special event can happen more than once in a match. However, it SE-Bigdata be increasingly difficult to happen.

Individual events
They are the most common and typical, such as Rapid that runs and marks or the one of Technician surpasses to a player with Air game.

When the game engine has decided that there SE-Bigdata be an individual event, it SE-Bigdata no longer verify the possession of the ball to decide which team has the opportunity, SE-Bigdata check the players of both teams, their specialties and positions.

Example: If the engine decides to create a Rapid event, it SE-Bigdata list all the relevant players on both teams and SE-Bigdata randomly select who SE-Bigdata be the event. In this way, comparing your alignment with that of the opponent, you SE-Bigdata know what the probabilities of having a specific event, and this SE-Bigdata lead to a new way of thinking tactics.

Team events
They SE-Bigdata continue depending on the possession, if the engine generates one it SE-Bigdata be more important than before, in a linear comparison between the qualifications of the middle of the field.

Climatic events
They SE-Bigdata be out of the process of generating events. A check SE-Bigdata be made at the start of the match and halfway. If one is generated, ALL the players of the game with the specific specialty SE-Bigdata be affected, gaining or losing a fixed percentage of their total contribution. A time event usually lasts for the entire game. But sometimes an event that starts in the first part can be reverted to the second.

The weather SE-Bigdata affect more players with specialties than before.

With the new generation code we believe we can level the specialties for their expected contribution and the frequency with which they happen, which was too difficult at the moment.

Specialties and events

We now check each specialty separately. For more details of each one, read our Dev Blog we have not published a general overview of all the skills that are used in each event.

Fast

Fast brand
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and dial. If the opponent in exactly the opposite position is also, then he has the 100% chance of stopping the attack. Nearby fast players can also stop him, but they have a much lower probability.

Fast it happens
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and take a pass.

Loss of rain and sun
If it rains or does Sol, all the fast ones SE-Bigdata suffer.

Strengthening counterattacks
If you want to be a counter attack expert, you SE-Bigdata not only need to have past players, also fast players to take advantage of.SE-Bigdataextreme, middle center or fast forward SE-Bigdata give a small increase to the tactics of counterattacks. The effect SE-Bigdata not be linear, the range begins from 0 to 2'8 levels of tactics. Remember that your opponent can reduce or cancel this increase depending on the number of fast players that have central, lateral or half centers.

Technician

Technician surpasses an air game
Any extreme, middle center or forward can overtake a rival if the exact opposite position is a player with airplay.

Loss with rain, gain with sun
Nothing changesSE-Bigdatatechnical player SE-Bigdata suffer with rain or play better with Sun.

Forward defensive technicians
No change. They continue to have an increase of 33% of their past to the lateral attacks.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
When you recover the ball in your own field, it is good to have someone to take a long pass to make a counterattack. Each central and lateral technical defense SE-Bigdata give you a small chance of creating the counterattack from a failed attack on the opponent, regardless of the tactics selected. The probability increases for each technical defense that is had, but not linearly.

Marking man
During a marking to the man, if the objective is a technician, there are possibilities that the effect is greater thanSE-Bigdataother player. If you have a player nearby, you may not be able to carry out its magic.

Unpredictable

Pass by unpredictable
Goalkeepers, central and lateral can create a good opportunity with a long pass.

Unpredictable generates chance against
He leaves you hand in hand with the goalkeeper. This event is by extremes, half centers and forwards.

Unpredictable special action
Any unpredictable except for goalkeepers can dribble the opponent and take a good pass. The player who SE-Bigdata receive the pass as an extreme or a striker.

Unpredictable error
The sides, midfielders and midfielders may have a bad day and make a fatal mistake. An opposite end or front may take advantage of the situation.

Unpredictable dangers in the creative tactical game
Then we SE-Bigdata enter in detail, but the experience and the past SE-Bigdata be important forSE-Bigdataplayer to increase the creative tactical game.

Marking man
Since you can not foresee an unpredictable player, it SE-Bigdata be much more difficult to mark it than other people.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
The events "Unpredictable generates an occasion against" and "Special action of unpredictable", if it does an extreme or forwards and is bankrupt, it can end up in a counterattack by the rival.

Powerful

Pressure tactic
No change. The defense skill counts double the level of tactics.

Loss with sun, gain with rain
Like before, all the powerful SE-Bigdata suffer with the Sun, but they SE-Bigdata improve with the rain.

Power forward ("Power forward in normal")
If you have a good striker playing in normal, you can use your body in the fight with the opponent, forcing a second chance to kick and score after a normal chance that your team has failed. Think that this physical game can cause you to end up seeing the yellow card! For this reason, if you have already taught one, you SE-Bigdata be more careful when using your body.

Half defensive center ("Half center powerful in defense")
If you play your mid center powerful defensive you can concentrate on cutting off rival attacks and stealing the ball. If he does, the opponent's attack SE-Bigdata end.

Powerful players score the best man.

Now the corners SE-Bigdata be more frequent, but it SE-Bigdata not be easy to makeSE-Bigdataprofit.

Corner finalized bySE-Bigdataplayer
You need a good player with a good ball stopped, and your level of offensive indirect offensive ball SE-Bigdata be compared to the defense of your opponent. If the ball receiver has enough scoring ability to overtake the goalkeeper, then he SE-Bigdata score.

Remember that your opponent can reduce or cancel this increase depending on the number of fast players that have central, lateral or half centers.

Technician

Technician surpasses an air game
Any extreme, middle center or forward can overtake a rival if the exact opposite position is a player with airplay.

Loss with rain, gain with sun
Nothing changesSE-Bigdatatechnical player SE-Bigdata suffer with rain or play better with Sun.

Forward defensive technicians
No change. They continue to have an increase of 33% of their past to the lateral attacks.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
When you recover the ball in your own field, it is good to have someone to take a long pass to make a counterattack. Each central and lateral technical defense SE-Bigdata give you a small chance of creating the counterattack from a failed attack on the opponent, regardless of the tactics selected. The probability increases for each technical defense that is had, but not linearly.

Marking man
During a marking to the man, if the objective is a technician, there are possibilities that the effect is greater thanSE-Bigdataother player. If you have a player nearby, you may not be able to carry out its magic.

Unpredictable

Pass by unpredictable
Goalkeepers, central and lateral can create a good opportunity with a long pass.

Unpredictable generates chance against
He leaves you hand in hand with the goalkeeper. This event is by extremes, half centers and forwards.

Unpredictable special action
Any unpredictable except for goalkeepers can dribble the opponent and take a good pass. The player who SE-Bigdata receive the pass as an extreme or a striker.

Unpredictable error
The sides, midfielders and midfielders may have a bad day and make a fatal mistake. An opposite end or front may take advantage of the situation.

Unpredictable dangers in the creative tactical game
Then we SE-Bigdata enter in detail, but the experience and the past SE-Bigdata be important forSE-Bigdataplayer to increase the creative tactical game.

Marking man
Since you can not foresee an unpredictable player, it SE-Bigdata be much more difficult to mark it than other people.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
The events "Unpredictable generates an occasion against" and "Special action of unpredictable", if it does an extreme or forwards and is bankrupt, it can end up in a counterattack by the rival.

Powerful

Pressure tactic
No change. The defense skill counts double the level of tactics.

Loss with sun, gain with rain
Like before, all the powerful SE-Bigdata suffer with the Sun, but they SE-Bigdata improve with the rain.

Power forward ("Power forward in normal")
If you have a good striker playing in normal, you can use your body in the fight with the opponent, forcing a second chance to kick and score after a normal chance that your team has failed. Think that this physical game can cause you to end up seeing the yellow card! For this reason, if you have already taught one, you SE-Bigdata be more careful when using your body.

Half defensive center ("Half center powerful in defense")
If you play your mid center powerful defensive you can concentrate on cutting off rival attacks and stealing the ball. If he does, the opponent's attack SE-Bigdata end.

Marking man
Powerful players score the best man.

Extremes

Far goes to company

If your end has surpassed the defense by the band, you can pass it to another extreme, forward or half offensive center

Far the center
As before, but if the receiver is an airborne player, it SE-Bigdata be much easier to score a goal.

Corner events
Now the corners SE-Bigdata be more frequent, but it SE-Bigdata not be easy to makeSE-Bigdataprofit.

Corner finalized bySE-Bigdataplayer
You need a good player with a good ball stopped, and your level of offensive indirect offensive ball SE-Bigdata be compared to the defense of your opponent. If the ball receiver has enough scoring ability to overtake the goalkeeper, then he SE-Bigdata score.

Corner kicked off by an airborne player
The same as before, but instead of having annotation skill, you just need to win the battle between the players with aerial game of both teams.

Both events may end up with a yellow card for the offensive team, but if your player already has a card he SE-Bigdata go with more account, so the risk of a second card is less.

Inexperience

We now compare the total experience of teams when such an event occurs. But if a team plays with a player less, the total experience is less and therefore is more likely to have an inexperience event. We SE-Bigdata now use the average.

Forward experienced brand
If your striker has a lot of experience compared to the average of the rivals, and has the ability to score sufficiently high to beat the goal keeper, then it can be scored.

Inexperienced defense
Just like before If your defense has little experience compared to the average rival team, they can exploit their errors. If it happens, a rival player can win the ball and have the option to score.

Resilent (formerly known as Quick Care)

Players with quick care are not a myth. They exist, and now we SE-Bigdata have to be born 50 times more frequently. Your injuries are less severe, and they cure more quickly. They SE-Bigdata also begin to diminish their abilities at an age slightly higher than the other players. To reflect its vigor and durability, we have renamed it "Resilent."

Game of specialties

We SE-Bigdata redesign the tactics and now there SE-Bigdata be a level of tactics, likeSE-Bigdataother. You SE-Bigdata increase the maximum number of special events of the match, but you SE-Bigdata also reduce your defensive qualification. Both the experience and the past (this one more than the first one) SE-Bigdata be important for the tactics game of specialties and the unpredictable ones SE-Bigdata have a double effect.

Teams that play with this tactic SE-Bigdata also increase the likelihood that when there is a special event, this team SE-Bigdata be the one who has it, regardless of the possession or the number of players with specialty of your team. If both teams play like that, either of them has this advantage.

Penalty for too many unique players

Counted and debated, we now have three combinations of specialties and positions, which make unique players appear: Defensive technical forwards, Power forwarders in normal, and Mig strong defensive centers. If you aligned two of the same type, you SE-Bigdata receive a penalty for your contribution. If you aligned three, it SE-Bigdata still be bigger. The effect of the penalty SE-Bigdata be relatively small, just big enough to make you think twice if you haveSE-Bigdataother alternative to aligning two equal unique players.

New specialty

A new specialty SE-Bigdata also be on Hattrick. The name SE-Bigdata be "Team Game". It SE-Bigdata be difficult to see, but not as fast as Cure. They SE-Bigdata begin appearing next season on the youth team, but we SE-Bigdata not make more information public, beyond the name of the specialty (N of the T: It is possible that the translators change the name of the specialty when we know what the players do with this specialty).

When SE-Bigdata all this happen?

We plan to implement these changes to the game at the end of the next season, but at the beginning they SE-Bigdata only be available in Tournaments matches, so everyone SE-Bigdata have the opportunity to try them or watch them, before they do not make the whole game effective 'here two seasons (at the beginning of 2018).

During this time, we may introduce some changes, as we SE-Bigdata hear your suggestions and continue testing and leveling the entire system. If this happens, we SE-Bigdata notify you before the final launch.

New system of Specialties and Special Events

2017-05-09 10:49:00

Our new system of specialties is much more in detail balanced and SE-Bigdata offer users the most interesting tactical variables, as well as new paths for a strategic construction of the team.

The key points of the change SE-Bigdata be a new and more transparent way to generate special events, important changes in the effects of current specialties, two new unique player roles, and finally, the introduction of a completely new specialty.

Let's take a closer look at the changes:

A new specialty and new unique roles

We SE-Bigdata introduce the "Team Player" specialty, we SE-Bigdata renew the old "Quick Care" and appear two new unique roles, the "Powerful Forer" and the "Defensive Midfield".

Most important link between the specialty and skills

The specialties SE-Bigdata now have a stronger bond with the skills of the players involved in the special event.

Generation process

The most important change is how to decide when and what special event happens, and how they are represented.

Now the game engine decides which team has the special event first, giving the team more likely to have it. Then a random player is chosen from the team that SE-Bigdata have it. Finally, you choose a category of events to check (fast, corners, etc.) and check which of these can be displayed by the selected player.

This system makes it quite difficult to predict what SE-Bigdata happen, and also complicates us to improve and match the system as a whole. So we have decided to change it totally.

In the future the process SE-Bigdata follow a different logic. First the match engine SE-Bigdata decide if there isSE-Bigdataevent. If there is one, you SE-Bigdata choose between two main categories: team and individual events, and finally an event corresponding to this category.

Any event related to the whole team (corners, inexperience, ...) belongs to a team event. Those that involve one or two players are of the individual category, which SE-Bigdata be more frequent, in general.

An important change is that each special event can happen more than once in a match. However, it SE-Bigdata be increasingly difficult to happen.

Individual events
They are the most common and typical, such as Rapid that runs and marks or the one of Technician surpasses to a player with Air game.

When the game engine has decided that there SE-Bigdata be an individual event, it SE-Bigdata no longer verify the possession of the ball to decide which team has the opportunity, SE-Bigdata check the players of both teams, their specialties and positions.

Example: If the engine decides to create a Rapid event, it SE-Bigdata list all the relevant players on both teams and SE-Bigdata randomly select who SE-Bigdata be the event. In this way, comparing your alignment with that of the opponent, you SE-Bigdata know what the probabilities of having a specific event, and this SE-Bigdata lead to a new way of thinking tactics.

Team events
They SE-Bigdata continue depending on the possession, if the engine generates one it SE-Bigdata be more important than before, in a linear comparison between the qualifications of the middle of the field.

Climatic events
They SE-Bigdata be out of the process of generating events. A check SE-Bigdata be made at the start of the match and halfway. If one is generated, ALL the players of the game with the specific specialty SE-Bigdata be affected, gaining or losing a fixed percentage of their total contribution. A time event usually lasts for the entire game. But sometimes an event that starts in the first part can be reverted to the second.

The weather SE-Bigdata affect more players with specialties than before.

With the new generation code we believe we can level the specialties for their expected contribution and the frequency with which they happen, which was too difficult at the moment.

Specialties and events

We now check each specialty separately. For more details of each one, read our Dev Blog we have not published a general overview of all the skills that are used in each event.

Fast

Fast brand
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and dial. If the opponent in exactly the opposite position is also, then he has the 100% chance of stopping the attack. Nearby fast players can also stop him, but they have a much lower probability.

Fast it happens
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and take a pass.

Loss of rain and sun
If it rains or does Sol, all the fast ones SE-Bigdata suffer.

Strengthening counterattacks

The effect SE-Bigdata not be linear, the range begins from 0 to 2'8 levels of tactics. Remember that your opponent can reduce or cancel this increase depending on the number of fast players that have central, lateral or half centers.

Any event related to the whole team (corners, inexperience, ...) belongs to a team event. Those that involve one or two players are of the individual category, which SE-Bigdata be more frequent, in general.

An important change is that each special event can happen more than once in a match. However, it SE-Bigdata be increasingly difficult to happen.

Individual events
They are the most common and typical, such as Rapid that runs and marks or the one of Technician surpasses to a player with Air game.

When the game engine has decided that there SE-Bigdata be an individual event, it SE-Bigdata no longer verify the possession of the ball to decide which team has the opportunity, SE-Bigdata check the players of both teams, their specialties and positions.

Example: If the engine decides to create a Rapid event, it SE-Bigdata list all the relevant players on both teams and SE-Bigdata randomly select who SE-Bigdata be the event. In this way, comparing your alignment with that of the opponent, you SE-Bigdata know what the probabilities of having a specific event, and this SE-Bigdata lead to a new way of thinking tactics.

Team events
They SE-Bigdata continue depending on the possession, if the engine generates one it SE-Bigdata be more important than before, in a linear comparison between the qualifications of the middle of the field.

Climatic events
They SE-Bigdata be out of the process of generating events. A check SE-Bigdata be made at the start of the match and halfway. If one is generated, ALL the players of the game with the specific specialty SE-Bigdata be affected, gaining or losing a fixed percentage of their total contribution. A time event usually lasts for the entire game. But sometimes an event that starts in the first part can be reverted to the second.

The weather SE-Bigdata affect more players with specialties than before.

With the new generation code we believe we can level the specialties for their expected contribution and the frequency with which they happen, which was too difficult at the moment.

Specialties and events

We now check each specialty separately. For more details of each one, read our Dev Blog we have not published a general overview of all the skills that are used in each event.

Fast

Fast brand
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and dial. If the opponent in exactly the opposite position is also, then he has the 100% chance of stopping the attack. Nearby fast players can also stop him, but they have a much lower probability.

Fast it happens
Any extreme, middle center or forward can start a run and take a pass.

Loss of rain and sun
If it rains or does Sol, all the fast ones SE-Bigdata suffer.

Strengthening counterattacks
If you want to be a counter attack expert, you SE-Bigdata not only need to have past players, also fast players to take advantage of.SE-Bigdataextreme, middle center or fast forward SE-Bigdata give a small increase to the tactics of counterattacks. The effect SE-Bigdata not be linear, the range begins from 0 to 2'8 levels of tactics. Remember that your opponent can reduce or cancel this increase depending on the number of fast players that have central, lateral or half centers.

Technician

Technician surpasses an air game
Any extreme, middle center or forward can overtake a rival if the exact opposite position is a player with airplay.

Loss with rain, gain with sun
Nothing changesSE-Bigdatatechnical player SE-Bigdata suffer with rain or play better with Sun.

Forward defensive technicians
No change. They continue to have an increase of 33% of their past to the lateral attacks.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
When you recover the ball in your own field, it is good to have someone to take a long pass to make a counterattack. Each central and lateral technical defense SE-Bigdata give you a small chance of creating the counterattack from a failed attack on the opponent, regardless of the tactics selected. The probability increases for each technical defense that is had, but not linearly.

Marking man
During a marking to the man, if the objective is a technician, there are possibilities that the effect is greater thanSE-Bigdataother player. If you have a player nearby, you may not be able to carry out its magic.

Unpredictable

Pass by unpredictable
Goalkeepers, central and lateral can create a good opportunity with a long pass.

Unpredictable generates chance against
He leaves you hand in hand with the goalkeeper. This event is by extremes, half centers and forwards.

Unpredictable special action
Any unpredictable except for goalkeepers can dribble the opponent and take a good pass. The player who SE-Bigdata receive the pass as an extreme or a striker.

Unpredictable error
The sides, midfielders and midfielders may have a bad day and make a fatal mistake. An opposite end or front may take advantage of the situation.

Unpredictable dangers in the creative tactical game
Then we SE-Bigdata enter in detail, but the experience and the past SE-Bigdata be important forSE-Bigdataplayer to increase the creative tactical game.

Marking man
Since you can not foresee an unpredictable player, it SE-Bigdata be much more difficult to mark it than other people.

Create a counterattack out of the tactics
The events "Unpredictable generates an occasion against" and "Special action of unpredictable", if it does an extreme or forwards and is bankrupt, it can end up in a counterattack by the rival.

Powerful

Pressure tactic
No change. The defense skill counts double the level of tactics.

Loss with sun, gain with rain
Like before, all the powerful SE-Bigdata suffer with the Sun, but they SE-Bigdata improve with the rain.

Power forward ("Power forward in normal")
If you have a good striker playing in normal, you can use your body in the fight with the opponent, forcing a second chance to kick and score after a normal chance that your team has failed. Think that this physical game can cause you to end up seeing the yellow card! For this reason, if you have already taught one, you SE-Bigdata be more careful when using your body.

Half defensive center ("Half center powerful in defense")
If you play your mid center powerful defensive you can concentrate on cutting off rival attacks and stealing the ball. If he does, the opponent's attack SE-Bigdata end.

Marking man
Powerful players score the best man.

Extremes

Far goes to company

If your end has surpassed the defense by the band, you can pass it to another extreme, forward or half offensive center

Far the center
As before, but if the receiver is an airborne player, it SE-Bigdata be much easier to score a goal.

Corner events
Now the corners SE-Bigdata be more frequent, but it SE-Bigdata not be easy to makeSE-Bigdataprofit.

Corner finalized bySE-Bigdataplayer
You need a good player with a good ball stopped, and your level of offensive indirect offensive ball SE-Bigdata be compared to the defense of your opponent. If the ball receiver has enough scoring ability to overtake the goalkeeper, then he SE-Bigdata score.

Corner kicked off by an airborne player
The same as before, but instead of having annotation skill, you just need to win the battle between the players with aerial game of both teams.

Both events may end up with a yellow card for the offensive team, but if your player already has a card he SE-Bigdata go with more account, so the risk of a second card is less.

Inexperience

We now compare the total experience of teams when such an event occurs. But if a team plays with a player less, the total experience is less and therefore is more likely to have an inexperience event. We SE-Bigdata now use the average.

Forward experienced brand
If your striker has a lot of experience compared to the average of the rivals, and has the ability to score sufficiently high to beat the goal keeper, then it can be scored.

Inexperienced defense
Just like before If your defense has little experience compared to the average rival team, they can exploit their errors. If it happens, a rival player can win the ball and have the option to score.

Resilent (formerly known as Quick Care)

Players with quick care are not a myth. They exist, and now we SE-Bigdata have to be born 50 times more frequently. Your injuries are less severe, and they cure more quickly. They SE-Bigdata also begin to diminish their abilities at an age slightly higher than the other players. To reflect its vigor and durability, we have renamed it "Resilent."

Game of specialties

We SE-Bigdata redesign the tactics and now there SE-Bigdata be a level of tactics, likeSE-Bigdataother. You SE-Bigdata increase the maximum number of special events of the match, but you SE-Bigdata also reduce your defensive qualification. Both the experience and the past (this one more than the first one) SE-Bigdata be important for the tactics game of specialties and the unpredictable ones SE-Bigdata have a double effect.

Teams that play with this tactic SE-Bigdata also increase the likelihood that when there is a special event, this team SE-Bigdata be the one who has it, regardless of the possession or the number of players with specialty of your team. If both teams play like that, either of them has this advantage.

Penalty for too many unique players

Counted and debated, we now have three combinations of specialties and positions, which make unique players appear: Defensive technical forwards, Power forwarders in normal, and Mig strong defensive centers. If you aligned two of the same type, you SE-Bigdata receive a penalty for your contribution. If you aligned three, it SE-Bigdata still be bigger. The effect of the penalty SE-Bigdata be relatively small, just big enough to make you think twice if you haveSE-Bigdataother alternative to aligning two equal unique players.

New specialty

A new specialty SE-Bigdata also be on Hattrick. The name SE-Bigdata be "Team Game". It SE-Bigdata be difficult to see, but not as fast as Cure. They SE-Bigdata begin appearing next season on the youth team, but we SE-Bigdata not make more information public, beyond the name of the specialty (N of the T: It is possible that the translators change the name of the specialty when we know what the players do with this specialty).

When SE-Bigdata all this happen?

We plan to implement these changes to the game at the end of the next season, but at the beginning they SE-Bigdata only be available in Tournaments matches, so everyone SE-Bigdata have the opportunity to try them or watch them, before they do not make the whole game effective 'here two seasons (at the beginning of 2018).

During this time, we may introduce some changes, as we SE-Bigdata hear your suggestions and continue testing and leveling the entire system. If this happens, we SE-Bigdata notify you before the final launch.
