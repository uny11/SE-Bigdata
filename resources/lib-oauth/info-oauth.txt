Using The Client
The oauth2.Client is based on httplib2 and works just as you'd expect it to.
The only difference is the first two arguments to the constructor are an instance of oauth2.Consumer
and oauth2.Token (oauth2.Token is only needed for three-legged requests).

import oauth2 as oauth

# Create your consumer with the proper key/secret.
consumer = oauth.Consumer(key="your-twitter-consumer-key",
    secret="your-twitter-consumer-secret")

# Request token URL for Twitter.
request_token_url = "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token"

# Create our client.
client = oauth.Client(consumer)

# The OAuth Client request works just like httplib2 for the most part.
resp, content = client.request(request_token_url, "GET")
print resp
print content
